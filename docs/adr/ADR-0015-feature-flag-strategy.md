## Context

The system requires a mechanism to enable or disable behaviours at runtime without
a full deployment. The primary use case is controlling `autonomous-mode` — whether
agents act without human-in-the-loop approval (HITL) or require it. Secondary use
cases include gradual rollout of new agent capabilities and kill-switch controls.

Requirements:

- **Vendor-neutral**: avoid hard lock-in to a SaaS provider
- **Local provider**: flags must work without external API calls (dev, test, air-gapped envs)
- **Audit trail**: flag evaluations should be loggable
- **Swap-friendly**: replacing the evaluation backend must not require application code changes

---

## Decision

Use **OpenFeature** (CNCF standard SDK) with **flagd** as the local evaluation backend.

**Why OpenFeature:**

- CNCF-graduated project — long-term support and broad ecosystem
- Provider interface abstracts the backend; swapping to LaunchDarkly, Unleash, or any
  other vendor requires only a provider change, not application code changes
- Python SDK (`openfeature-sdk`) is stable and well-maintained

**Why flagd:**

- Lightweight Go binary — runs as a sidecar or k8s Deployment
- Reads flag definitions from YAML/JSON files mounted as ConfigMaps — no external DB
- Supports OpenFeature remote evaluation protocol (OFREP) over HTTP
- Zero SaaS dependency — flags are fully self-hosted

**Fallback behaviour:**
When flagd is unavailable (local dev, unit tests without a provider configured), the
application falls back to `settings.autonomous_mode_enabled` from `config.py`. This
ensures the application remains functional without flagd running.

---

## Consequences

### Positive

- Provider-neutral: migrate to LaunchDarkly, Unleash, or GrowthBook without touching
  `src/shared/feature_flags.py` or callers
- Flags are version-controlled YAML files — changes go through PR review
- `InMemoryProvider` enables full unit testing without network calls
- flagd can be upgraded independently of the application

### Negative

- Adds `openfeature-sdk` as a runtime dependency
- flagd sidecar adds operational overhead (container, ConfigMap mount, health check)
- Remote evaluation adds ~1 ms latency per flag check (mitigated by flagd caching)

### Neutral

- Flag definitions live in `infrastructure/feature-flags/flags/` and are mounted as
  ConfigMaps in the k8s Deployment; changes require a ConfigMap update (no pod restart)

## Alternatives Considered

| Alternative          | Reason rejected                                               |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| LaunchDarkly SaaS    | Vendor lock-in; requires external API key and internet access |
| Unleash self-hosted  | Requires PostgreSQL; heavier than flagd for the current scope |
| GrowthBook           | Focused on A/B testing; overkill for kill-switch use case     |
| Config env vars only | No runtime toggle; requires pod restart for every change      |

---

## Implementation Reference

- `src/shared/feature_flags.py` — `is_autonomous_mode_enabled()` using OpenFeature SDK
- `infrastructure/feature-flags/flags/autonomous-mode.yaml` — flag definition
- `infrastructure/feature-flags/flagd.yaml` — k8s Deployment + Service for flagd
- `tests/unit/shared/test_feature_flags.py` — tests using `InMemoryProvider`
