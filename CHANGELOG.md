## [Unreleased]

### Security

- **Governance enforcement (REM-008) + version single-source-of-truth (REM-010).** Added
  `.github/workflows/pr-governance.yml` enforcing a **Conventional-Commit PR title**, a
  **CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]` entry** (docs-only / `skip-changelog` / Dependabot exempt), and a
  **spec reference** for feat/fix/security/privacy/perf PRs (`no-spec` / Dependabot exempt); the
  harness `spec-compliance` gate is now `blocking: true`. Reconciled **`version.txt` → `1.15.0`**
  (was `1.9.1`; it's read by `config.py`/`Makefile`) and added a **version-consistency** gate that
  fails any PR changing `version.txt` or `pyproject.toml` without keeping them equal
  (release-please bot exempt). ISO 5.36, SOC 2 CC5.

- **CI/release supply-chain hardening (REM-006, REM-007).** Added a **Trivy** image CVE scan to
  `ci.yml` (fails the build on fixable CRITICAL/HIGH; ISO 8.7, SOC 2 CC6.8). **SHA-pinned all 17
  GitHub Actions** to commit digests (version comments retained), added least-privilege top-level
  `permissions:` blocks to the 10 workflows that lacked them, and added signed **SLSA build
  provenance** (`actions/attest-build-provenance`) to `release.yml` — moving the pipeline from
  SLSA L1-partial toward a clean **L2**. The remaining REM-007 sub-items (OIDC for registry/cloud
  auth; admission-time signature verification) need real cloud/cluster infra and are tracked as
  **REM-011**.

- **HITL operator authentication (REM-001).** `POST /v1/hitl/requests/{id}/decision` now
  requires a JWT **bearer** token carrying the `hitl-operator` role, and the approver identity
  is taken from the **verified token subject** instead of the request body — closing an
  impersonation / audit-forgery hole (anyone could previously approve agent actions and assert
  any `approver_id`). New `src/api/rest/auth.py`; `PyJWT` dependency added; `hitl_operator_role`
  setting added. Unit tests cover missing/invalid/expired token → 401, wrong role → 403, and
  identity-from-token (a spoofed body `approver_id` is ignored).
- **Scoped auto-merge (REM-005).** `.github/workflows/auto-merge.yml` now only auto-approves +
  merges **documentation-only** PRs or **Dependabot** dependency bumps; any PR touching code,
  infrastructure, workflows, or guardrails falls back to mandatory human review — restoring
  segregation of duties / four-eyes (ISO 27001 A.5.3/A.8.32, SOC 2 CC8.1).

### Documentation

- **`CLAUDE.md`** — documented the now-blocking PR governance gates (REM-008/REM-010) so they
  are discoverable before a PR is opened. Added **§7.1 "CI-Enforced Gates"** (Conventional PR
  title, CHANGELOG-under-`[Unreleased]`, spec-reference, and `version.txt` ⇄ `pyproject.toml`
  version-consistency checks, plus their `skip-changelog` / `no-spec` escape-hatch labels and the
  `ci.yml` job list), expanded the §6 Conventional-Commit `Types` list to match what the
  `pr-governance` grammar actually accepts (added `perf`, `ci`, `build`, `style`, `revert`), and
  noted that **`version.txt` is the single source of truth** for the project version. Bumped the
  behavioral-contract doc header to 2.1.1.

### Added

- **`docs/compliance/`** — compliance & control-mapping package for enterprise vendor-risk
  reviews. Includes the full **ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Annex A** control matrix (93 controls with
  status + evidence), a **SOC 2** Trust Services Criteria mapping, a **SLSA v1.0** supply-chain
  assessment, a prioritised **remediation register** (unified with the threat model's `REM-`
  backlog; new items REM-005–010), a prospect-facing **trust summary**, and a
  **security-questionnaire quick-reference**. Wired into `.github/CODEOWNERS`
  (`@org/security-lead @org/tech-lead`), `SECURITY.md`, and the MkDocs nav. This is a
  self-assessment, not a certification; it openly tracks gaps — notably segregation-of-duties
  vs. the `auto-merge.yml` workflow (REM-005) and the unauthenticated HITL operator endpoint
  (REM-001).

### Fixed

- **CI green-up (`Lint` + `Contract Drift Check`).** `main`'s CI was red, which blocked
  branch protection. Fixes:
  - **`src/shared/llm_client.py`** — `AnthropicLLMClient` referenced `settings.anthropic_api_key`
    / `settings.anthropic_model`, which do not exist on `Settings` (the fields are `llm_api_key`
    / `llm_model`). This was a latent `AttributeError` at first real LLM call. Also narrowed the
    response content block to `TextBlock` before reading `.text`.
  - **`src/observability/logger.py`** — added the missing `StructuredLogger.debug()` method;
    `broker.py` and `vector_store.py` called `logger.debug(...)` which would have raised
    `AttributeError` on those code paths.
  - **`src/shared/broker.py`** — `InMemoryBroker` gained no-op `start()`/`stop()` so it satisfies
    the same interface as `KafkaEventBroker` (lifespan calls `broker.start()` on the union).
  - **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`** — the "Check services.yaml references valid schema files" step
    used bare `python3` (no PyYAML) instead of `uv run python`, failing with `ModuleNotFoundError:
No module named 'yaml'`.
  - Remaining mypy-strict, ruff, and formatting fixes across `src/` (type annotations, `raise ...
from`, `zip(..., strict=...)`, unused-variable cleanup) plus `ruff format` normalisation of
    test files. `pyproject.toml` ruff config: excluded `scaffold/templates` (linted via their own
    config when scaffolded) and added per-file-ignores for the `scaffold/` CLI (`T201`) and tests.

### Added

- **`alembic/versions/0004_create_requests.py`** and **`0005_create_hitl_archive.py`** —
  Two migrations ported from the abandoned `master` branch (were `0002`/`0003` there).
  Renumbered to chain onto `main`'s head (`0001→0002→0003→0004→0005`, single head verified
  with `alembic heads`). `0004` creates the `requests` table (durable fallback when Redis TTL
  evicts in-flight request state); `0005` creates the append-only `hitl_requests_archive`
  table (long-term HITL audit record beyond Redis TTL; REVOKEs UPDATE/DELETE from the app
  role). Both are additive — no table-name conflict with `main`'s existing schema. Note: no
  ORM models read these tables yet; they are schema-only until a persistent request/HITL
  store is wired in `src/`.
- **`docs/quickstart/local-dev-setup.md`** — Local development environment setup guide,
  ported from the `docs/template-improvements` branch. Covers devcontainer setup, required
  tool versions, IDE extensions, and common-error troubleshooting — a gap `main`'s quickstart
  set did not previously cover. The one stale link (to `TEMPLATE_USAGE.md`, not ported) was
  repointed to `CUSTOMISING.md`.
- **`scaffold/`** — Service scaffolding system ported from the abandoned `master` branch.
  `scaffold/scaffold.py` plus templates for Python, Java, Go, and Next.js frontend services.
  Implements the `make new-service NAME=foo LANG=python|java|go` command that CLAUDE.md
  documented but `main` had never implemented.
- **`infrastructure/terraform/modules/{database,message-broker,observability,vector-db}/`** —
  Four Terraform modules ported from `master`. These were empty `.gitkeep` stubs in `main`
  (main.tf + outputs.tf + variables.tf each). `terraform fmt`-normalised on import.
- **`docs/adr/ADR-0025-language-selection.md`** — Language Selection for New Services, ported
  from `master` (was ADR-0016 there; renumbered to avoid collision with `main`'s
  ADR-0016-agent-sandbox-execution-policy). Decision matrix mapping workload type → runtime;
  pairs with the scaffold system.
- **`infrastructure/terraform/README.md`** and per-module `README.md` files for all 11
  Terraform modules (`networking`, `kubernetes`, `database`, `cache`, `message-broker`,
  `vector-db`, `observability`, `api-gateway`, `domain-service`, `event-worker`, `frontend`).
  The Terraform tree previously had zero documentation. The top-level README covers
  prerequisites, provider pinning, quick start, the EKS-OIDC bootstrapping order
  (`-target=module.networking -target=module.kubernetes` on first apply), remote-state setup,
  and a dev/staging/production comparison table. Each module README follows `terraform-docs`
  style (Purpose · Resources · Inputs · Outputs · Usage) and documents key gotchas: dev omits
  `database`/`message-broker`, the `event-worker` MSK/DLQ IAM policies are conditional on their
  ARN inputs, and `default_replication_factor` must be ≤ broker count. Docs-only — no `.tf`
  changes.

### Changed

- **`docs/adr/README.md`** — Added missing Core Architecture index rows for ADR-0022 (Testing
  Strategy), ADR-0023 (Frontend Architecture), ADR-0024 (API Versioning Strategy), and the
  new ADR-0025 (Language Selection).

### Security

- **`.github/workflows/auto-merge.yml`** — ⚠️ **Governance exception (owner-requested).**
  Added a workflow that auto-approves and auto-merges pull requests targeting `main` once
  required checks pass, and enabled the repo `allow_auto_merge` / `delete_branch_on_merge`
  settings plus "Actions may approve PRs". This **intentionally bypasses** the human review
  gate in CLAUDE.md §7 and `.github/CODEOWNERS`. It triggers on `pull_request` (not
  `pull_request_target`) and is gated to same-repo PRs, so fork PRs — which receive only a
  read-only token — are **not** auto-merged. The job never checks out or executes PR code
  (API calls only). Delete the workflow file to restore manual review.

## [1.15.0] — 2026-05-28

### Added

- **`tests/e2e/test_hitl_operator_ui.py`** — HITL operator E2E tests (Wave 10.1). Covers
  CUJ-002: HITL status endpoint reflecting queue depth, APPROVE decision removing request
  from queue, REJECT decision with valid rationale, short-rationale 422, unknown-ID 404,
  double-decision 404, and invalid decision enum 422. Uses FastAPI ASGI transport (no real
  server required); set `BASE_URL` to run against a live server. Marked `e2e`.
- **`tests/e2e/test_request_lifecycle.py`** — Request lifecycle E2E tests (Wave 10.2). Covers
  CUJ-001 and CUJ-003: 202 Accepted on submit, request_id in message, valid priority values,
  empty/oversized/invalid-priority 422, no-store 503, immediate status poll returning queued,
  unknown-ID 404, all contracted fields present, PII not echoed in response, submit latency
  < 500 ms, poll latency < 200 ms, 10 concurrent submissions all succeed with unique IDs.
  Marked `e2e`.
- **`tests/performance/k6/request-api-load.js`** — k6 load test for `POST /v1/requests`
  (Wave 10.3). Three scenarios: ramp-up (1→50 VUs over 2 min), sustained (50 VUs for 5 min),
  spike (200 VUs for 1 min). SLO-aligned thresholds: submit p99 < 500 ms, poll p99 < 200 ms,
  error rate < 0.5%. Handles 429 with Retry-After backoff. `handleSummary` prints a concise
  SLO pass/fail table.
- **`tests/performance/k6/hitl-decision-load.js`** — k6 load test for HITL decision endpoint
  (Wave 10.4). Two scenarios: operator baseline (5 concurrent operators, 3 min), operator surge
  (15 operators, 1 min). Seeds pending requests via the submission endpoint. 80/20 approve/reject
  split; tracks `decisions_submitted_total`, `approvals_total`, `rejections_total`. Thresholds:
  decision p95 < 300 ms, decision p99 < 500 ms.
- **`tests/performance/benchmarks/test_orchestrator_benchmarks.py`** — Orchestrator hot-path
  benchmarks (Wave 10.5). Uses `time.perf_counter_ns()` for microsecond-resolution measurement
  over 200–1 000 iterations. Covers: `mask_text` short/long (≤ 5/10 ms), `mask_dict` flat/nested/
  clean (≤ 5/10/2 ms), `RiskScorer.score` low/high/PII-tokens (≤ 2 ms each), monotonicity
  invariant (delete > read), `PromptInjectionGuard.check` clean/malicious/long-clean (≤ 5/5/10 ms),
  and full sync pipeline PII→injection→risk (≤ 12 ms). Marked `benchmark`.
- **`tests/contract/test_rest_pact_provider.py`** — Pact provider verification against the
  Wave 6.5 consumer contracts (Wave 10.6). 9 test classes (one per Pact interaction), each
  firing real HTTP requests through the FastAPI ASGI stack with direct store seeding for
  provider state setup. Includes a coverage-contract test that fails when a new Pact interaction
  lacks a provider test class. Marked `unit`.

### Changed

- **`pyproject.toml`** — Added two new pytest markers: `e2e` (full user journey; opt-in via
  `BASE_URL`) and `benchmark` (latency assertions against SLO thresholds). `--strict-markers`
  already enforced; new markers prevent spurious "unknown marker" warnings.

---

## [1.14.0] — 2026-05-28

### Added

- **`infrastructure/helm/domain-service/`** — Helm chart for the Java/Spring Boot domain-service
  (Wave 9.1). 9 files: Chart.yaml, values.yaml, values-staging.yaml, values-production.yaml,
  templates/\_helpers.tpl, deployment.yaml (Spring Actuator probes, readOnlyRootFilesystem,
  tmpfs volume, Prometheus annotations), service.yaml, serviceaccount.yaml (IRSA annotation
  support), hpa.yaml (CPU + memory metrics), pdb.yaml. Spring-specific: JAVA_OPTS JVM tuning,
  `/actuator/health/liveness` and `/actuator/health/readiness` probes, 60 s graceful drain.
- **`infrastructure/helm/event-worker/`** — Helm chart for the Go Kafka consumer (Wave 9.2).
  10 files: Chart.yaml, values.yaml, values-staging.yaml, values-production.yaml,
  templates/\_helpers.tpl, configmap.yaml (Kafka bootstrap, group ID, topics, timeouts),
  deployment.yaml (WORKER_ID injected from pod name via Downward API, metrics port only),
  service.yaml (metrics-only ClusterIP), serviceaccount.yaml, hpa.yaml (CPU + Kafka
  consumer lag via prometheus-adapter, conservative 600 s scale-down window), pdb.yaml.
- **`infrastructure/helm/frontend/`** — Helm chart for the Next.js frontend (Wave 9.3).
  11 files: Chart.yaml, values.yaml, values-staging.yaml, values-production.yaml,
  templates/_helpers.tpl, configmap.yaml (NEXT_PUBLIC_\* and server-side env vars; includes
  build-time warning comment), deployment.yaml (checksum annotation for ConfigMap-triggered
  rollouts, secretRef optional for pre-auth deployments), service.yaml, ingress.yaml
  (TLS + cert-manager), serviceaccount.yaml, hpa.yaml (CPU), pdb.yaml.
- **`infrastructure/terraform/modules/api-gateway/`** — Terraform application module for the
  api-gateway (Wave 9.4). main.tf (IRSA role with WebIdentity trust, Secrets Manager read
  policy scoped to `monorepo/{env}/api-gateway/*`, CloudWatch Logs write policy, Helm release
  with local chart path, `lifecycle.ignore_changes` for image tag), variables.tf (OIDC inputs,
  secrets ARNs, Helm values file path), outputs.tf (IRSA role ARN, Helm release status).
- **`infrastructure/terraform/modules/domain-service/`** — Terraform application module for
  the domain-service (Wave 9.5). Follows api-gateway pattern; adds db_secret_arn variable
  granting explicit Secrets Manager access to the PostgreSQL credential secret (ADR-0018).
- **`infrastructure/terraform/modules/event-worker/`** — Terraform application module for the
  event-worker (Wave 9.5). Adds optional MSK cluster access policy (kafka-cluster:\* actions)
  and optional SQS DLQ send policy; both conditioned on non-empty variable values so the
  module works without MSK in local/staging environments.

### Changed

- **`infrastructure/terraform/environments/staging/main.tf`** — Wired the three new
  application modules (api_gateway, domain_service, event_worker) into the staging environment.
  Added `data.aws_caller_identity.current` for account ID resolution, `db_secret_arn` and
  `image_tag` input variables, and IRSA role ARN outputs for all three services.

---

## [1.13.0] — 2026-05-28

### Added

- **`specs/security/rbac-model.md`** — HITL RBAC spec (Wave 8.1). Defines three roles
  (`hitl:operator`, `hitl:supervisor`, `hitl:auditor`), an action type permission matrix
  (operators cannot approve `deploy`, `database_write`, `delete_resource`, or `escalate_privilege`),
  JWT claim requirements (`sub` as `approver_id`, `roles` claim, `iss`/`aud` validation),
  enforcement points in api-gateway middleware and audit logger, and implementation status
  tracking for each deferred component. Addresses threat-model REM-001.
- **`specs/security/pentest-checklist.md`** — Pre-production penetration testing checklist
  (Wave 8.2). 50 items across 10 sections aligned with the STRIDE threat model: authentication
  (S), authorisation/privilege escalation (E), injection (T), data exposure (I), audit/repudiation
  (R), denial of service (D), dependency vulnerabilities (supply chain), infrastructure
  configuration, and OWASP LLM Top 10. Includes sign-off table for Security Lead PRR gate.

### Changed

- **`.github/workflows/ci-java.yml`** — OWASP Dependency-Check is now a **blocking gate**
  (Wave 8.3). Removed `continue-on-error: true`; added `-Ddependency-check.failBuildOnCVSS=7`
  (fails on CVSS ≥ 7.0, i.e. HIGH and CRITICAL). Suppression file (`dependency-check-suppressions.xml`)
  explicitly wired. Report artifact uploaded on every run for audit. False positives must be
  documented in the suppressions file with CVE ID and rationale.
- **`.github/workflows/ci-go.yml`** — Added `govulncheck` as a **blocking gate** in the
  `lint-go` job (Wave 8.4). Scans all Go service directories; fails on any reachable vulnerability
  in the Go vulnerability database. Call-graph analysis means only actually-called vulnerable
  code paths trigger a failure — not unreachable transitive dependencies.
- **`.github/workflows/ci-frontend.yml`** — Added `pnpm audit --audit-level=high` as a
  **blocking gate** in the `lint-frontend` job (Wave 8.5). Fails on HIGH or CRITICAL CVEs in
  any direct or transitive Node.js dependency. Runs before ESLint so the build fails fast on
  known-vulnerable packages.

---

## [1.12.0] — 2026-05-28

### Added

- **`docs/sre/runbooks/api-gateway-high-error-rate.md`** — Runbook (Wave 7.1). Five-step
  triage procedure covering error severity classification, root-cause branches (recent deploy,
  upstream dependency, LLM provider, resource exhaustion), containment, rollback, and
  post-incident checklist. References `skills/change-management/deploy-rollback.md`.
- **`docs/sre/runbooks/hitl-queue-backlog.md`** — Runbook (Wave 7.2). Covers operator
  unavailability, portal failure, action-type flood, and risk-scorer over-escalation. Includes
  governance-gated emergency drain procedure with required AI Governance Lead sign-off per
  ADR-0011.
- **`docs/sre/runbooks/kafka-consumer-lag.md`** — Runbook (Wave 7.3). Covers pod OOM,
  broker degradation, slow consumer, and poison-pill messages. Documents partition rebalance,
  poison-pill skip procedure (with data-loss declaration), and DLQ replay path.
- **`docs/sre/runbooks/redis-connection-failure.md`** — Runbook (Wave 7.4). Covers pod
  failure, network policy, TLS expiry, OOM, and auth failure. Documents production safety
  rules (in-memory fallback blocked), data-loss communication protocol, and
  GDPR/LGPD breach assessment trigger. ADR-0019.
- **`docs/sre/cuj/CUJ-002-hitl-decision-flow.md`** — HITL operator CUJ (Wave 7.5). SLO
  targets (p95 decision latency ≤ 300 s, queue depth ≤ 100, 100% audit write). Happy path,
  dependency table, failure scenarios, degraded path procedure, and test coverage map.
- **`docs/sre/cuj/CUJ-003-agent-autonomous-resolution.md`** — Autonomous resolution CUJ
  (Wave 7.6). SLO targets (≥ 80% autonomous rate, p95 ≤ 5 000 tokens, p99 ≤ 15 iterations).
  Full HOTL happy path, failure scenarios including runaway self-reflection, autonomy boundary
  enforcement note, and test coverage map.
- **`infrastructure/monitoring/prometheus/rules/slo-burn-rate.yaml`** — Multi-window SLO
  burn-rate alert rules (Wave 7.8). Covers: HITL availability fast/slow burn (1h/6h),
  HITL decision latency p95 warning/critical, HITL queue depth warning/critical, audit log
  write failure (hard invariant, fires immediately), autonomous resolution rate warning/critical,
  token cost p95 warning/critical, self-reflection iteration runaway, and API gateway
  availability fast/slow burn. All rules linked to runbooks.
- **`infrastructure/monitoring/grafana/dashboards/finops-cost-allocation.json`** — FinOps
  cost allocation dashboard (Wave 7.9). Nine panels: monthly budget utilisation gauge,
  estimated days until budget exhausted, total tokens stat, monthly budget stat, input/output
  token daily trend, real-time consumption rate vs sustainable rate, cost-per-resolution
  p50/p95/p99 table by action_type (with threshold colouring at 5k/10k), top-10 action types
  by total 30d cost, and burn-rate ratio vs 1.0× and 14.4× thresholds. ADR-0020.

### Changed

- **`docs/sre/slo/slo.yaml`** — Version bumped to 1.1; added two new service blocks
  (Wave 7.7): `hitl-system` (4 SLOs: availability, decision latency p95, queue depth, audit
  write) and `agent-autonomous` (3 SLOs: autonomous resolution rate, token cost p95,
  self-reflection iterations p99). All new SLOs carry multi-window burn-rate alert references
  and runbook pointers.

  and v2 planning candidates. ADR-0024.
- **`docs/adr/ADR-0024-api-versioning-strategy.md`** — API versioning strategy ADR (Wave 6.4).
  Unifies versioning rules across REST (URL-major), AsyncAPI/Kafka (topic rename + dual-publish),
  and gRPC/Protobuf (field permanence + service-level deprecation). Includes consumer
  compatibility requirements and governance sign-off table.
- **`tests/contract/pacts/frontend-api_gateway.json`** — Pact v2 consumer contract file
  (Wave 6.5). Nine interactions covering `POST /v1/requests`, `GET /v1/requests/{id}` (queued,

  `agent.feedback.applied` and `agent.harness.state` marked `beta`. ADR-0024.

---

## [1.10.0] — 2026-05-28

### Added

- **`skills/domain/domain-modeling.md`** — Domain modeling skill (Wave 5.1). DDD tactical
  patterns (entities, value objects, aggregates, repositories, domain events) with reference
  examples from the Java domain-service and Python src/ layouts. Includes a new-concept
  checklist and anti-pattern table.
- **`skills/engineering/testing-strategy.md`** — Testing strategy skill (Wave 5.2). Test

  Injection Fix)

### Added (cont.)

- **Redis TLS connection support** (`src/api/rest/main.py`): `REDIS_TLS_ENABLED` and

  47 unit tests with 100% branch coverage
- **Data retention job** (`src/jobs/retention_job.py`): `RetentionJob` enforces
  `specs/privacy/data-retention.md` — deletes expired `agent_memory_documents`, archives
  and hard-deletes aged `audit_events`, verifies compliance post-sweep

- `src/shared/config.py`: added `sandbox_*`, `feedback_*`, `memory_*`, and
  `harness_patch_proposal_threshold` settings

### Fixed

  severity tiers, per-commit breakdown, and test impact table (PR #7)

---

## [1.2.0] - 2026-05-26

### Fixed

- `src/api/rest/routers/hitl.py`: `hitl_status` endpoint replaced stale `gateway._requests`
  dict access (AttributeError 500) with `gateway._store.pending_count()` — aligned with the
  HITLStore protocol introduced in Wave 3b (ADR-0011)
- `src/observability/metrics.py`: removed duplicate `ACTIVE_HITL_REQUESTS.dec()` from
  `record_hitl_decision()` — gauge lifecycle is the gateway's responsibility; double-decrement
  drove the gauge negative on every approved/rejected decision (ADR-0011)
- `src/agents/hitl_gateway.py`: `record_decision()` now archives APPROVED/REJECTED requests
  via `store.archive()` so `pending_count()` stays accurate and the hard cap is not inflated
  by decided entries (ADR-0011)
- `harness/doc-check.yml`: `spec-exists` and `adr-current` gates rewritten to use
  `PR_BODY_FILE` (mirrors spec-compliance fix); removed `.git/MERGE_MSG` primary source which
  is only populated during local merges and causes false-passes in PR CI (specs/ai/guardrails.md)
- `src/agents/harness/coordinator.py`: PII masking applied pre-LLM (`_generate()`) and
  pre-HITL (`_escalate_to_hitl()`, `_review_spec_with_hitl()`) via `mask_text` / `mask_dict`
  — three mandatory interception points enforced (specs/ai/guardrails.md, ADR-0012)
- `src/agents/hitl_gateway.py`: `ACTIVE_HITL_REQUESTS` gauge now decrements correctly on
  APPROVED/REJECTED decisions — was only decrementing on EXPIRED (ADR-0011)
- `harness/code-check.yml`: `spec-compliance` gate rewritten to use `PR_BODY_FILE` and avoid
  false-pass when it is unset; set `blocking: false`
- `src/agents/harness/coordinator.py` (`_run_simplified`): uses caller-supplied
  `success_criteria` or a description-anchored fallback — removes vague generic criterion
  (specs/ai/harness-design.md §2)
- `skills/privacy/pii.md`: removed fictitious `L2_FIELD_NAMES` registry block; replaced with
  accurate guidance — masking is value-pattern-based, not field-name-based (ADR-0012)
- `src/agents/harness/models.py`: `TaskBrief` gains optional `success_criteria` field
- `harness/code-check.yml`: SAST gate replaced `semgrep || true` with `bandit -r src/ -ll`
  (authoritative SAST tool per `skills/devsecops/secret-scanning.md`)
- `harness/code-check.yml` / `harness/staging-check.yml`: pii-scan gate `|| true` bypass
  removed; staging-check regex fixed (`[^[]` instead of broken `[^\[MASKED]`)
- `skills/ai/guardrails.md` / `skills/privacy/pii.md`: `[TOKEN]` reclassified from L3 to L2
  (JWT/session tokens are Sensitive, not Internal) (ADR-0012)
- `src/guardrails/prompt_injection_guard.py`: dead `_check_length()` method removed (was
  defined but never called in `validate()`)

### Added

- `tests/unit/agents/test_hitl_gateway.py`: gauge-decrement tests (approved + rejected paths)
  and archive tests (approved, rejected, pending count accuracy)
- `tests/unit/guardrails/test_audit_logger.py`: 9 tests covering all 4 query filters, limit,
  copy-on-append, event ID return, and `AuditWriteError` propagation
- `tests/unit/guardrails/test_action_limits.py`: 8 tests for `check_scope_limit()` and the
  unified `check()` guardrail (scope denial, rate limit denial, within-limits pass)

  `InMemoryHITLStore` is created when no store is supplied

---

## [1.1.1] - 2026-05-26

### Fixed

- `src/guardrails/pii_filter.py`: `_get_patterns()` promovido para `ClassVar` — 7 regexes compiladas uma vez no import em vez de a cada chamada a `detect()` / `mask_text()` (hot path: executa antes de todo log write e LLM call) (ADR-0012)
- `src/guardrails/prompt_injection_guard.py`: `RejectionReason.NESTED_INSTRUCTION` removido do enum — era dead code não utilizado pelo guard e exposto na API pública (ADR-0012)
- `src/shared/config.py`: `database_url` e `redis_url` agora validados em produção — placeholders rejeitados no startup (ADR-0008); `SECRET_KEY` com menos de 32 chars rejeitado quando `JWT_ALGORITHM=HS256`
- `src/shared/config.py`: `service_version` lido dinamicamente de `version.txt` em vez de hardcoded `"0.0.0"` (ADR-0002)
- `src/api/rest/main.py`: `AsyncGenerator[None, None]` corrigido para `AsyncGenerator[None]` — default arg desnecessário removido (UP043, Python 3.13)
- `alembic/versions/0001_create_audit_events.py`: role do DB lido do `alembic.ini` via `context.config.get_main_option("db_app_role", "app_user")` em vez de hardcoded; `REVOKE` envolto em guard `DO $$ IF EXISTS` para não falhar silenciosamente se a role não existir (ADR-0011)
- `alembic/env.py`: substituído `engine_from_config` síncrono por `create_async_engine` + `asyncio.run()` — codebase só tem asyncpg, sem psycopg2 (ADR-0002)
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: job `build` agora requer `[test-unit, test-security, test-integration]` — antes podia rodar com testes falhando; Kafka atualizado de `7.6.0` para `7.7.0`
- `.github/workflows/cd-production.yml`: gates de canary substituídos de `bc` (não disponível no ubuntu-latest) para `python3`; estratégias de deploy restritas a `[canary]`
- `docker-compose.yml`: Redis com `--save 60 1` (persistência activada); Kafka com listener `INTERNAL://kafka:29092` para comunicação inter-container sem usar o listener externo

### Added

- `tests/conftest.py`: fixtures `stub_llm` (`StubLLMClient`) e `audit_logger` (`AuditLogger` + `InMemoryAuditStorage`) disponíveis globalmente para todos os testes — elimina duplicação inline
- `mkdocs.yml`: configuração mínima do mkdocs-material criada — `make docs-serve` e `mkdocs build --strict` agora funcionam; nav cobre todos os docs existentes (ADRs, AI Governance, Privacy, SRE, Change Management)
- `.github/dependabot.yml`: Dependabot configurado para pip e github-actions com cadência semanal e limite de 5 PRs por ecossistema
- `infrastructure/message-broker/schema-registry/avro/`: 6 schemas Avro stub criados com os nomes exatos referenciados em `services.yaml` (`request-created-v1.avsc`, `hitl-decision-v1.avsc`, `audit-event-v1.avsc`, `domain-entity-created-v1.avsc`, `domain-entity-updated-v1.avsc`, `event-processed-v1.avsc`) — CI `contract-drift` agora passa (ADR-0003)
- `tests/unit/shared/test_config.py`: 3 novos testes — `DATABASE_URL` com placeholder rejeitado em produção, `REDIS_URL` com placeholder rejeitado em produção, `SECRET_KEY` curto com HS256 rejeitado

### Changed

- `pyproject.toml`: alinhado para Python 3.13 — `requires-python = ">=3.13"`, `ruff target-version = "py313"`, `mypy python_version = "3.13"`; adicionado `"alembic/**" = ["S608"]` em `per-file-ignores` (SQL dinâmico é padrão em migrations)
- `Dockerfile`: ambos os stages atualizados de `python:3.12-slim` para `python:3.13-slim`
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: todos os 4 steps `setup-python` atualizados de `"3.12"` para `"3.13"`
- `.env.example`: `REDIS_PASSWORD=devpassword` e `REDIS_URL` com senha adicionados; alinhado com `docker-compose.yml`
- `Makefile`: `make new-service` agora cria estrutura mínima Python (`src/<name>/`, `__init__.py`, `README.md`, `pyproject.toml`) em vez de diretório vazio
- `.gitignore`: `resumo-*.md` e `site/` adicionados para evitar commit de artifacts de sessão e build do mkdocs

### Removed

- `resumo-memória-2026-05-26.md`: artifact de sessão Claude Code removido do repositório

---

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-25

### Added (P3 Wave 3c — platform maturity)

- `src/shared/feature_flags.py`: `is_autonomous_mode_enabled()` — thin OpenFeature SDK
  wrapper that evaluates the `autonomous-mode` flag; falls back to
  `settings.autonomous_mode_enabled` when the SDK is unavailable (ADR-0015)
- `docs/adr/ADR-0015-feature-flag-strategy.md`: documents choice of OpenFeature + flagd —
  vendor-neutral CNCF standard; provider swap (LaunchDarkly, Unleash) requires no
  application code changes
- `infrastructure/feature-flags/flags/autonomous-mode.yaml`: flag definition with
  `defaultVariant: "off"` (HITL required by default)
- `infrastructure/feature-flags/flagd.yaml`: k8s Deployment + Service + ConfigMap for
  flagd (lightweight OpenFeature evaluation server reading flags from mounted YAML)
- `infrastructure/k8s/prometheus-adapter-config.yaml`: Prometheus Adapter ConfigMap with
  rules mapping `agent_semaphore_waiting` and `kafka_consumer_lag` to `custom.metrics.k8s.io`
- `tests/unit/shared/test_feature_flags.py`: 6 unit tests using `InMemoryProvider` —
  flag on/off, SDK-overrides-settings, fallback on SDK error

### Changed (P3 Wave 3c — platform maturity)

- `src/agents/orchestrator/orchestrator.py`: HITL routing now gated by
  `is_autonomous_mode_enabled()` — when autonomous mode is enabled (HOTL), high-risk
  actions bypass HITL approval; disabled by default for safety
- `infrastructure/k8s/hpa.yaml`: added custom-metric rules for `agent_semaphore_waiting`
  (scale when avg > 3 waiting per pod) and `kafka_consumer_lag` (scale when lag > 5000);
  added `behavior` block with stabilization windows to prevent thrashing (PRR-CAP-001)
- `pyproject.toml`: added `openfeature-sdk>=0.4.0` to runtime dependencies

### Added (P3 Wave 3b — HITL Redis persistence)

- `src/agents/hitl_store.py`: `HITLStore` Protocol + `InMemoryHITLStore` + `HITLRedisStore` —
  pluggable persistence backends for HITL requests; Redis-backed store survives pod restarts
  (ADR-0011). Schema: `hitl:req:{id}` (active, TTL = expires_at + 24 h grace),
  `hitl:pending` sorted set (score = expires_at timestamp), `hitl:expired:{id}` (7-day audit archive)
- `docs/runbooks/RB-003-hitl-recovery.md`: HITL recovery runbook covering pod restart, Redis
  failover, stuck queue, capacity exhaustion, and manual key inspection (satisfies PRR-OPS-002)
- `tests/integration/test_hitl_redis_store.py`: 14 integration tests for `HITLRedisStore`
  using `fakeredis` (no external service required) — save/get round-trip, TTL semantics,
  archive, pending-expired queries

### Changed (P3 Wave 3b — HITL Redis persistence)

- `src/agents/hitl_gateway.py`: `HITLGateway` now accepts an injectable `store: HITLStore`
  parameter; defines `HITLStore` Protocol; defaults to `InMemoryHITLStore` via lazy import
  when no store is provided — breaks no existing callers
- `src/api/rest/main.py`: lifespan startup selects `HITLRedisStore` when Redis is available,
  falls back to `InMemoryHITLStore` for local dev; wires store into `HITLGateway`
- `src/shared/config.py`: added `hitl_redis_key_prefix`, `hitl_redis_ttl_grace_hours`,
  `hitl_expired_ttl_days` configuration fields
- `tests/unit/agents/test_hitl_gateway.py`: updated to construct `InMemoryHITLStore` explicitly
  and inject into `HITLGateway`; assertions updated from direct dict access to store API
- `pyproject.toml`: added `fakeredis>=2.0.0` to dev dependencies

### Added (P3 Wave 3a — quick wins)

- `infrastructure/k8s/deployment.yaml`: `startupProbe` added (httpGet `/health`,
  `failureThreshold: 30`, `periodSeconds: 10` — 5-minute startup window). Prevents
  premature liveness kills during slow boot (asyncpg pool + Redis ping). Reduced
  `livenessProbe.initialDelaySeconds` from 15 → 5 since startupProbe owns the
  startup gate.
- `infrastructure/monitoring/grafana/cuj-dashboards/CUJ-001-user-request-processing.json`:
  Grafana dashboard covering all 7 steps of CUJ-001 with 12 panels — SLO stat rows
  (availability ≥ 99.9%, p99 latency ≤ 500ms, HITL approval ≤ 300s, error budget),
  time-series for request rate/latency/HITL queue/decisions/semaphore saturation/LLM
  tokens/DLQ depth. Satisfies PRR-OBS-005 (blocking).

### Added (harness audit P2 — operational resilience)

- `src/shared/db_client.py`: `ResilientDBPool` — wraps `asyncpg.Pool` with per-call
  `asyncio.wait_for` timeout, exponential-backoff retry via `with_retry`, and three-state
  circuit breaker via `CircuitBreaker`; reuses existing patterns from `retry.py` (ADR-0002)
- `src/api/rest/main.py`: `asyncio.Semaphore(settings.max_concurrent_agents)` created at
  startup — caps simultaneous agent coroutines to prevent event-loop starvation under burst load
- `src/observability/metrics.py`: `AGENT_SEMAPHORE_WAITING` gauge (requests waiting for a slot)
  and `DLQ_MESSAGES_COUNTER` counter (messages routed to Dead Letter Queue)
- `tests/unit/shared/test_db_client.py`: 9 unit tests — happy path, circuit breaker states,
  timeout propagation
- `tests/unit/agents/test_hitl_gateway.py`: 7 unit tests — hard cap enforcement, post-expiry
  eviction, slot recycling after eviction
- `tests/unit/api/test_requests_semaphore.py`: 4 unit tests — 503 + `Retry-After` when all
  slots occupied, 202 when capacity available, backwards-compatibility without semaphore state

### Fixed (harness audit P2 — operational resilience)

- `src/api/rest/main.py`: DB pool now wrapped in `ResilientDBPool` — every query gets
  timeout + retry + circuit breaker protection (previously unguarded)
- `src/guardrails/audit_logger.py`: `PostgresAuditStorage` type annotation updated to accept
  `ResilientDBPool` alongside `asyncpg.Pool` — no runtime behaviour change
- `src/agents/hitl_gateway.py`: `expire_stale_requests()` now evicts expired entries from
  `_requests` dict after marking them EXPIRED — prevents unbounded memory growth
- `src/agents/hitl_gateway.py`: `submit_for_approval()` raises `HITLGatewayError` when store
  reaches `settings.hitl_max_pending_requests` — explicit backpressure instead of silent OOM
- `src/shared/config.py`: added `max_concurrent_agents: int = 20` and
  `hitl_max_pending_requests: int = 500` configuration fields
- `src/api/rest/routers/requests.py`: endpoint returns 503 + `Retry-After: 5` header when
  `agent_semaphore._value == 0` — operationally visible backpressure
- `tests/chaos/experiments/network-partition.yaml`: DLQ assertion regex escaped and aligned
  to real metric name `dlq_messages_total`
- `.github/workflows/chaos-schedule.yml`: schedule updated to weekday nightly runs
  (`0 2 * * 1-5`) — chaos experiments now committed and active in CI

### Fixed (harness audit P1 — production safety)

- `infrastructure/k8s/pdb.yaml`: `minAvailable` corrected from 1 → 2 to satisfy PRR-CAP-003;
  prevents zero-replica windows during node drains with a 2-replica deployment
- `infrastructure/monitoring/prometheus/rules/golden-signals.yaml`: `AgentActionErrorRate` query
  label corrected from `outcome=` to `result=` to match `agent_actions_total` label in `metrics.py`
- `infrastructure/monitoring/prometheus/rules/golden-signals.yaml`: `LLMTokenBudgetNearing` query
  fixed to use actual metric names (`llm_tokens_total{token_type="input"}` / `llm_tokens_budget_total`)
- `src/api/rest/main.py`: `asyncpg.create_pool()` wrapped in `asyncio.wait_for(timeout=15s)` and
  Redis ping wrapped in `asyncio.wait_for(timeout=5s)` to prevent infinite boot loops on
  unresponsive dependencies
- `src/api/rest/main.py`: `InMemoryAuditStorage` fallback now raises `RuntimeError` when
  `app_env == "production"` — prevents silent audit record loss on pod restart

### Added (harness audit P1 — production safety)

- `src/shared/config.py`: `model_validator` rejects placeholder secrets (`LLM_API_KEY`,
  `SECRET_KEY`) when `app_env == "production"` — fail-fast at startup prevents misconfigured pods
  from reaching first LLM call
- `src/observability/metrics.py`: `LLM_TOKEN_BUDGET` gauge (`llm_tokens_budget_total`) and
  `init_budget_gauge()` helper — sets the static monthly budget at startup so the
  `LLMTokenBudgetNearing` alert can compute a ratio
- `tests/unit/shared/test_config.py`: 7 unit tests covering production secret validation
  (placeholder rejection, environment scoping, case-insensitivity)
- `tests/unit/shared/test_metrics.py`: 3 unit tests for `init_budget_gauge()` and
  `LLM_TOKEN_BUDGET` gauge behaviour

### Added (harness engineering compliance — ADR-0014, ADR-0011)

- `src/shared/retry.py` — `TransientError`, `CircuitBreakerError`, `with_retry()` tenacity decorator
  (exponential backoff + jitter), `CircuitBreaker` (CLOSED/OPEN/HALF_OPEN state machine),
  `ResilientLLMClientWrapper` composing timeout + circuit breaker + retry (ADR-0014)
- `src/shared/llm_client.py`: `TimeoutLLMClientWrapper` applying `asyncio.wait_for` ceiling on
  all LLM calls — prevents event loop starvation from unresponsive upstream (ADR-0014)
- `src/guardrails/audit_logger.py`: `PostgresAuditStorage` full implementation backed by asyncpg;
  parameterized INSERT-only writes, parameterized SELECT with optional filters; wired as default
  production backend when DB pool is available (ADR-0011)
- `alembic/versions/0001_create_audit_events.py` — migration creating `audit_events` table with
  two composite indexes and `REVOKE UPDATE, DELETE` for append-only enforcement (ADR-0011)
- `alembic/env.py`, `alembic.ini` — Alembic configuration wired to `settings.database_url` (ADR-0002)
- `src/guardrails/action_limits.py`: `ActionLimiter.check(action_type, parameters)` — unified
  async entry point combining scope and rate checks; raises `ValueError` on denial (ADR-0014)
- `src/api/rest/_limiter.py` — shared slowapi `Limiter` singleton keyed by client IP (ADR-0002)
- `infrastructure/k8s/deployment.yaml` — K8s Deployment with liveness/readiness probes,
  `preStop` hook, resource requests/limits, and RollingUpdate strategy (ADR-0005)
- `infrastructure/k8s/service.yaml` — ClusterIP Service for agent-service (ADR-0005)
- `infrastructure/k8s/pdb.yaml` — PodDisruptionBudget `minAvailable: 1` (PRR-CAP-003) (ADR-0005)
- `infrastructure/k8s/hpa.yaml` — HorizontalPodAutoscaler 70% CPU target, 2–10 replicas
  (PRR-CAP-001) (ADR-0005)
- `tests/chaos/experiments/kill-agent.yaml` — Chaos Toolkit experiment: kill pod, verify
  Golden Signals recovery (specs/sre/game-day-playbook.md)
- `tests/chaos/experiments/network-partition.yaml` — Chaos Toolkit experiment: agent ↔ Kafka
  partition via Toxiproxy, verify DLQ routing and lag recovery (ADR-0007)
- `tests/chaos/experiments/broker-outage.yaml` — Chaos Toolkit experiment: Kafka StatefulSet
  scaled to 0, verify producer buffering and zero data loss (ADR-0007)
- `.github/workflows/chaos-schedule.yml` — weekly scheduled chaos CI running all three
  experiments against staging (specs/sre/game-day-playbook.md)

### Changed (harness engineering compliance — ADR-0014, ADR-0011)

- `src/api/rest/main.py`: lifespan now initializes asyncpg pool, Redis client, `AuditLogger`
  (PostgresAuditStorage in prod, InMemoryAuditStorage on failed pool), and `HITLGateway` in
  `app.state`; mounts `/metrics` ASGI app; registers slowapi middleware and rate-limit handler;
  wires OTel `FastAPIInstrumentor` (ADR-0002, ADR-0003, ADR-0011)
- `src/api/rest/routers/health.py`: `/ready` performs real asyncpg and Redis connectivity
  checks with `asyncio.wait_for` timeouts; returns 503 when either dependency is unreachable
  (ADR-0002)
- `src/api/rest/routers/hitl.py`: implemented `get_hitl_gateway` dependency, `hitl_status`
  returning real pending count from `app.state.hitl_gateway`, and `submit_decision` calling
  `gateway.record_decision()` (ADR-0011)
- `src/api/rest/routers/requests.py`: `submit_request` decorated with
  `@limiter.limit("{rate_limit_requests_per_minute}/minute")` to enforce per-IP rate limit
  (ADR-0002)
- `src/agents/hitl_gateway.py`: added `asyncio.Lock` protecting `_requests` dict; all
  read/write operations use phase-separated locking (state transition under lock, I/O outside)
  (ADR-0011)
- `src/agents/orchestrator/orchestrator.py`: `_act()` now `await`s `action_limiter.check()`
  using the new unified method signature (ADR-0014)
- `src/shared/config.py`: added `llm_call_timeout_seconds`, `redis_call_timeout_seconds`,
  `shutdown_drain_seconds`, `llm_circuit_breaker_threshold`, `llm_circuit_breaker_reset_seconds`,
  `llm_retry_max_attempts` (ADR-0014)
- `Dockerfile`: replaced `CMD` with `ENTRYPOINT` (exec form) and added `STOPSIGNAL SIGTERM`
  so uvicorn receives signals directly as PID 1 (ADR-0005)
- `pyproject.toml`: added `tenacity>=8.3.0` and `slowapi>=0.1.9` to production dependencies

### Added

- Avro schemas (5 arquivos) em `infrastructure/message-broker/schema-registry/avro/` cobrindo
  todos os 8 event types do catálogo: `domain_request.avsc`, `agent_action.avsc`,
  `hitl_decision.avsc`, `domain_result.avsc`, `audit_event.avsc` (ADR-0003, ADR-0005)
- `tests/integration/test_kafka_events.py` — testes de contrato Kafka: envelope structure,
  PII masking pre-publish, topic naming convention, UUID v4 idempotency key,
  non-PII field preservation (ADR-0003, ADR-0012)

### Fixed

- `skills/ai/guardrails.md`: corrigidos nomes de métodos errados (`audit_logger.record()` →
  `await audit_logger.log_event(AuditEvent(...))`, `injection_guard.check()` →
  `injection_guard.validate()`, `result.rejected` → `not result.is_valid`,
  `result.category` → `result.rejection_reason`) (P0-01)
- `skills/ai/guardrails.md`: tokens de masking corrigidos de `[MASKED_L2]`/`[MASKED_L1]`
  para tokens por tipo `[EMAIL]`/`[CPF]` conforme implementação real em `pii_filter.py` (P0-02)
- `skills/privacy/pii.md`: tabela de Classification Levels e exemplo de teste corrigidos —
  `[MASKED_L1/L2/L3]` → `[CPF]`/`[CARD]`, `[EMAIL]`/`[PHONE]`/`[IP]`, `[TOKEN]`/`[UUID]`
  (P0-03, ADR-0012)
- `specs/ai/guardrails.md`: tabela de masking tokens no Layer 1 PII Filter corrigida para
  tokens por tipo, alinhando spec com código e ADR-0012 (P0-04 / P1-04)
- `src/shared/config.py`: adicionados `hitl_risk_threshold: float = 0.4` e
  `hotl_override_window_seconds: int = 300` — campos referenciados pelo orchestrator e
  ausentes da configuração (P0-05, ADR-0011, specs/ai/hitl-hotl.md)
- `specs/README.md`: `specs/api/async-api-design.md` registrado na tabela de ownership
  com Owner: Tech Lead, Reviewer: DevOps Lead, Status: Approved (P1-01)
